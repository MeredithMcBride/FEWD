		7 . Policies are reactive, not proactive. Ex) Japan:
	There is a high cost of being elected. No political incentive to alleviate corruption amongst politicians bureaucrats and business.
	No comprehensive anti corruption law, no ACA to implement such laws. Culture of gift giving allows for perpetuation of bribery. Low rates of reporting to law enforcement. 

Laurence Cockcroft: 3 key obsacles: 
1.	Importance of the black market economy
2.	Illegal channeling of funds
3.	Western governments support of corrupt governments.
Can war on corruption we won in Asia?
	Adopt anti-corruption strategies as adopted by HK and Singapore:
1.	Give governments incentive to curb corruption. Sincere leaders are the only way to increase govt commitment
2.	Initiate a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy
3.	Provide the ACA with sufficient staff, budget, and training to perform its objectives correctly.
4.	Periodic review of anti-corruption laws in order to plug loopholes. New laws can deal with new challenges ex) cyber crime
5.	Focus on investigation, prevention and education. (ICAC)
6.	Anti corruption laws must be forced IMPARTIALLY regardless of the position of the offender. NO more impunity for high ranking officials. Ex) editor of famous HK newspaper
7.	The ACA cannot be used as a weapon by the govt against opposition political party leaders. This is very common in Asia.
When corruption is allowed to perpetuate, the average man pays the cost.

South Korea has an ineffective whistle blowing act, but one of the few countries in Asia that has one.
